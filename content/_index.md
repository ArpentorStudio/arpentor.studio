## Our values

- We maintain a work space that prioritizes the well-being of all members of our organization. That work space must be caring, inclusive, tolerant and encouraging diversity.
- All members of the organization understand the reasons behind our decisions and our way of working.
- Any form of authority in the organization derives from the attribution of a role to a person. That authority is clearly defined and voidable.
- We refuse to exploit cognitive biases in order to encourage our public to pay more money than they intended to spend.

## Our next game

Our first game as a studio will bring the replayability of a deck builder to the strategy of a city builder. You will build increasingly influent cities. Each card in your deck will represent a building to add to your city. You'll be able to get new cards each turn, to improve your deck and thus your city. You will skilfully place your buildings to maximize their production. You will build many cities, until you create your very own nation!

## Phytomancer

[Phytomancer](https://daydreel.itch.io/phytomancer) is the first game that we've created and sold, along with [Ana Maria de Jesus](https://www.artstation.com/jesuslovesyou), [Alexis Saler](https://www.fossilrecords.fr/) and [Daydreel](https://daydreel.itch.io/). It's a strategy game in which you will defend nature against the invasion of pollution. Plant magic seeds to clean a cell up, grow a sturdy tree or accelerate the propagation of grass. Surround the polluting factories with nature to bring balance back to the world. The game contains 10 levels of increasing difficulty and is [available for 3â‚¬ on itch.io](https://daydreel.itch.io/phytomancer).
